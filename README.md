 Hi, I’m Ella Raney. I’m interested in learning more about different coding languages and what I can do with them! This is where I work on that. I’m currently learning MATLAB at UF and C++ on my own. My fun fact is that I have a collection of every state and U.S. territory quarter ever minted... except for Iowa. I'm always on the lookout!
